Amanda grew up with two older sisters, Paula and Elizabeth Waters, from whom she learned about having patience. She attended school at Woodview Elementary School for&nbsp;seven years, Kindergarten through the sixth grade, and then she went to Northwood Middle School from her seventh and eighth grade education and finally finished up at Northwood High School from ninth to twelfth grade. During Amanda's time from elementary through her freshman year she played volleyball and basketball, which she enjoyed so much. </span></p><br /><p><span style="font-size: small; color: #ffffff; font-family: comic sans ms,sans-serif;">Outside of school Amanda kept herself busy. She worked many part time jobs but her steady summer job was working at Belleville Softball Park in South Bend, IN, where she continues to work summers. She also attended The First Church of God in Nappanee where she grew in a relationship with God and started many friendships that will last a lifetime.</span></p><br /><p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 7.3pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 7.3pt"><span style="font-size: small; color: #ffffff; font-family: comic sans ms,sans-serif;">&nbsp;After high school Amanda applied to many colleges but decided that staying close to home was best for her so she started attending Indiana University South Bend (IUSB). When she enrolled as a freshman her major was pre-nursing but after two semesters Amanda learned that her passion was for another field, Radiography so she switched majors. She will be entering the Radiography program at the end of June 2008 and hopes to finish her education in May 2010 with an Associates of Science Degree. Amanda will be eligible to take the American Registry of Radiological Technologists once she graduates and hopes to then obtain a job at a local hospital. </span></p><br /></p></div>

<div class="text_wrapper" style="margin-left: 225px"><p style="TEXT-ALIGN: left"><span style="font-size: small; color: #ffffff; font-family: comic sans ms,sans-serif;">Peter and Amanda met in June of 2005 through a mutual friend, Ryne Johnston who is the bestman for the wedding. They spent everyday together when they first met talking on the phone for hours at a time, spending every available moment together just trying to get to know one another. Peter asked Amanda to be his girlfriend after a night of cosmic bowling with a big group of friends, which was an activity they did together a lot when they first met. Amanda said she wanted to think about it a few days and then on July 23, 2005 while Peter was driving Amanda home to Nappanee she said she yes to being his girlfriend. The next yea and a half&nbsp;were amazing as the two grew closer&nbsp;becoming the best of friends and growing in love for one of another.</span></p><br /><p><span style="font-size: small; color: #ffffff; font-family: comic sans ms,sans-serif;">Then on March 3, 2007, Peter asked Amanda that question that all little girls dream of hearing, "Will You Marry Me?" Amanda answered yes between her tears of joy and the two started to talk marriage. A break soon came though since at the end of April of 2007 Peter was diagnosed with cancer and a wedding was the last thing we had time to do. Fighting cancer became our mission! After several months of surgery, chemotherapy and horrible illness Peter became increasingly better and the cancer was GONE! It has since stayed gone and Peter and I are looking forward to celebrating our three-year anniversary in July 2008 and Peter's one-year remission of cancer in September 2008.</span></p></div>
